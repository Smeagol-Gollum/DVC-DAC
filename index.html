        <p>Conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The DAC is entirely self sustaining and entirely open source via github.</li>
          <li>The DAC has a wallet it has access to and it controls</li>
          <li>The DAC has a domain that is paid for by itself annually(from it's own wallet).</li>
          <li>The DAC has a hosting service that is paid for by itself monthly (from it's own wallet).</li>
          <li>The DAC's website does something in return for a payment (at the very least an entry on the website detailing the latest donations time/date and optional donor name eg: John Doe donated $xx.xx; or Anonymous donated Btc x.xxxxxx.).</li>
          <li>The DAC's website contains a short explanation of what it is and what it does, plus a link to the github project.</li>
          <li>In good faith, the author agrees to have the DAC run for at least 5 years after payment of the bounty, IF the DAC can pay for itself in that time - (of course this is unenforceable, but the DAC should "live" so long as it has funds to do so.)</li>
